# Orbitals
- Main notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Noah-Burns/Orbitals/main?filepath=Orbitals.ipynb)<br>Just wait to launch and click ![>|Run](./data/run.png). 3-D plots are interactive, zoom with rclick and rotate with lclick.
- Notebook documenting symbolic math: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Noah-Burns/Orbitals/main?filepath=Orbitals%20Documented.ipynb)

The notebooks are easily accessible through the Binders above, no installation of anything needed but may take a minute to start up.

## Dependencies
- [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/)
- [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Current notebook TODOs
- Better figure sizing/responsiveness, difficult if they're going to still be mpl figures
- Mark classically forbidden region on 3-D plot
- Smarter "plotting sphere" range, adjustable?
- More colors
- Power rule color scaling? Would make lower-probability points more visible, making larger orbitals with more radial nodes much more visible.


## Eventual formats
- Standalone python app
- Real webapp of some sort?
